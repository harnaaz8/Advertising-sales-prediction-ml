# Advertising-sales-prediction-ml
Supervised Machine Learning project using Linear Regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditure.
Project Overview

This project builds a Supervised Machine Learning regression model to predict product sales based on advertising expenditure across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.

The objective is to analyze the impact of marketing budget allocation on sales performance and evaluate predictive accuracy using regression metrics.

Problem Statement

Given advertising spend data across multiple channels, we aim to:

Understand relationships between advertising channels and sales

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate model performance using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE

Analyze feature influence on predicted sales

Dataset Information

Key Insights


Advertising expenditure significantly impacts sales.

TV and Radio budgets show stronger predictive influence.

Feature scaling does not significantly impact basic Linear Regression performance.
